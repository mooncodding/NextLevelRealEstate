                                <h3>Features to Consider</h3>
                            </div>
                            <p>When buying real estate in Dubai, you must clearly understand the purpose of acquiring this type of asset. In the case of buying a home for permanent residence, the potential owner should focus on areas that match their budget and personal preferences.</p>
                            <p>When purchasing properties for commercial purposes, it is worth considering areas that generate a high ROI, such as International City (8.24%), Dubai Studio City (7.61%) or Bluewaters Island (7.1%). However, indicators of rental yields alone are not enough to make an informed decision.</p>
                            <p>If you’re at a loss at trying to make a choice, Metropolitan real estate agents are ready to provide you with all the information you need, as our experts regularly conduct in-depth research on the Dubai real estate market with a schedule and forecasts of possible changes in price levels, as well as supply and demand. Having this information will give you a deeper understanding of the Dubai housing market and will allow you to become aware of properties that are the most popular. One of our key goals as a business is to compile an investment portfolio with optimal passive income.</p>
                            <p>To be able to buy a home in Dubai, you cannot do without the involvement of a qualified intermediary. According to the requirements of local legislation, foreign investors have the right to choose and view properties, as well as to negotiate with sellers on their own. But in accordance with the requirements of the Dubai Land Department, further documentary registration of the transaction and the transfer of ownership must be carried out with the assistance of a lawyer or a real estate agency.</p>
                            <p>Our company offers a wide range of consulting services, including planning, market research of the real estate market and property valuations. Our staff will help you find the best property options for you, taking into account your budget, preferences and goals (investment or personal residence). Our company specialists are ready to offer you full support at all stages of a purchase, from the selection of a property and preparation of paperwork to the transfer of ownership, as well as providing investment property management services.</p>

                                <h3>Features of Dubai Areas</h3>
                            </div>
                            <p>It is important for investors who wish to buy real estate in Dubai to know one more thing – not all projects can be purchased by foreigners. Foreign citizens have the right to buy or rent residences long term in freehold and leasehold areas.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="text">

                                <h3>Freehold and Leasehold Areas</h3>
                            </div>
                            <p>According to the UN, as of 2020, 88% of the population of the United Arab Emirates account for foreign citizens. For this reason, the country is well adapted to accommodate expats of all different nationalities. Foreigners who have received the status of a UAE resident can largely count on the same rights and freedoms as local residents.</p>
                            <p>According to Article 4 of Law No. 7 of 2006, foreigners who are not citizens of a GCC country have the right to purchase, lease or rent out land/real estate only in specially designated freehold zones. The properties purchased in these zones can be used as a permanent residence, resold to third parties, donated or inherited. Currently, there are 23 freehold districts in Dubai, such as Jumeirah Lake Towers, Dubai Marina and Arabian Ranches, among many others.</p>
                            <p>There are also leasehold areas in the Emirate. Real estate and land in these zones are not for sale, but they can be rented for a period of 10 to 99 years for the purpose of independent living or subleased to third parties. You cannot sell, donate or inherit this type of unit. A complete list of leasehold and freehold districts is established in Regulations No. 2 of 2006 (as amended).</p>

                                <h3>Areas for Living and Investment</h3>
                            </div>
                            <p>The purchase of Dubai residential property by foreigners is designated for:</p>
                            <p>* Permanent residence in the Emirate</p>
                            <p>* Generating passive rental income</p>
                            <p>The choice of a suitable area and a type of property depends on the purpose of its acquisition. The range of residences in Dubai is very extensive, since it includes ready-made, off-plan real estate, as well as properties in the secondary market, from affordable apartments to luxury townhouses and premium villas. Specialists from Metropolitan Premium Properties will help you to not only decide on the purpose of the purchase, but also select the best property options that meet your requirements and budget.</p>
                            <p>Real estate for a permanent residence is selected based on the convenience, budget and personal preferences of the owner, and not on the basis of market indicators. On the other hand, investment properties are acquired for the purpose of making a profit. To do this, the investor needs to pick a property with an appropriate price, quality and location. Real estate agents, translators and lawyers of Metropolitan Premium Properties will assist with this task quickly and efficiently.</p>

                            </div>
                            <p>Part of the Emirate’s territory is designated for large industrial zones. Foreign companies and private individuals can invest in production facilities, ports, warehouses and logistics facilities. Labor accommodation is also in high demand among investors.</p>
                            <p>The government of Dubai is promoting the growth of the country’s industrial potential by offering various initiatives to enterprises and investors involved in this industry, including the exemption from customs duties on the import of raw materials and equipment, as well as tax incentives, just to name a few.</p>
                            <p>Currently, there are 7 industrial zones in Dubai: Ras Al Khor Industrial Area, Al Quoz Industrial Area, Al Safa, Al Khubaisi, Umm Ramool, Al Qusais and Jebel Ali.</p>

                            <p>Commercial real estate is another promising niche for foreign investors. As with residential properties, expats have the right to purchase or rent commercial properties in designated areas like DIFC and Jebel Ali, for example.</p>
                            <p>The commercial real estate industry in Dubai is very extensive, covering the rental and sale of office space, co-working spaces, retail units, warehouses, showrooms, shopping malls and industrial facilities. Often, individual premises or entire floors of residential buildings are available for commercial purposes. Our experts are ready to help you understand all the nuances of commercial properties in Dubai and how to acquire them.</p>

                                <h3>Best Areas for Living</h3>
                            </div>
                            <p>Almost any property can be found in Dubai, from modest budget studios to penthouses, villas or premium apartments.</p>
                            <p>Areas with affordable properties include:</p>
                            <p>International City. There are mainly studios and 1-3 bedroom apartments available for sale here. The average annual rent for a 1-bedroom apartment is AED 30,000 (USD 8,200). Buying this type of property will cost you a minimum of AED 215,000 (USD 60,000).
                            </p>
                            <p>Dubai Silicon Oasis. There are plenty of both residential and commercial properties here. The average annual rental price for a 1-bedroom apartment is AED 32,000 (USD 9,000), while the starting selling price is AED 249,000 (USD 79,000).</p>
                            <p>Dubai Sports City. The annual rental cost of a 1-bedroom apartment in this area starts from AED 32,000 (USD 9,000). To purchase, units are priced at a minimum of AED 260,000 (USD 71,000).</p>
                            <p>Budget-friendly and premium areas differ, not only in the class of real estate. Infrastructure plays an essential role here; the availability of public transport routes, access to key highways of the emirate, sufficient parking spaces, as well as the proximity to different developments from education facilities to tourist and cultural attractions. Therefore, it is not the real estate itself that comes to the forefront, but the lifestyle that each specific community can offer – the availability of swimming pools, play areas, shopping facilities, spas, fitness centers, entertainment spots and educational institutions, among other necessary amenities.</p>
                            <p>Coastal areas are the best choice for long term investments. In the past few years, high development potential has been witnessed in areas such as Business Bay and Dubai Creek. Another promising development is Emaar Beachfront, the newest addition of one of the largest developers in the Emirates, Emaar Properties. Dubai Creek Harbour also deserves a special mention, as it is set to become a huge residential area with many attractions, including the entire Dubai Square shopping district and the upcoming tallest tower in the world, Dubai Creek Tower. Buyers searching for more affordable options should consider completed or off-plan projects by trusted developers such as Emaar, Nakheel, Meraas or Select Group.</p>
                            <p>Among other areas offering luxury real estate are:</p>
                            <p>Dubai Creek Harbour. The developers plan to build 6 residential towers with premium apartments overlooking the harbour and the bustling boulevard. Purchase prices of a 1-bedroom apartment will cost from AED 900,000 (USD 245,000).</p>
                            <p>Dubai Marina. There are more than 200 residential towers with 1-4 bedroom apartments and 5-bedroom penthouses, as well as a limited collection of villas located here. The annual rental price of 1-bedroom apartments in Dubai Marina starts at AED 66,000 (USD 18,000) while villas cost from AED 144,000 (USD 40,000). The average purchase price of a 1-bedroom apartment in Dubai Marina starts from AED 1,000,000 (USD 272,000) and a 2-bedroom villa – from AED 4,700,000 (USD 1,300,000).</p>
                            <p>Bluewaters Island. This area offers 10 mid-rise towers with premium apartments, penthouses and an exclusive collection of townhouses. The starting rental price for 1-bedroom apartments is AED 134,000 (USD 37,000) per annum, while the cost for purchasing these types of properties are priced at a minimum of AED 2,300,000 (USD 630,000).</p>
                            <p>Specialists in our company will help you choose the best property in the most suitable area for you. Our qualified agents are ready to take on all procedural and documentary issues regarding the purchase or rental of a property of any class and purpose.</p>

                                <h3>New Areas of Dubai</h3>
                            </div>
                            <p>District 2020 leads the list of new districts in Dubai. This project was launched in preparation for the international exhibition of Expo 2020, which is taking place from 1 October 2021 to 31 March 2022.</p>
                            <p>District 2020 is set to become a major innovation district in the Emirate. Now it is home to 136 exhibition pavilions and other buildings, including the exhibition center. The technologically advanced development is built as a large glass dome with incredible interactive panels on the façade. Upon completion of Expo, District 2020 will be redesigned as an independent area and will become a new free trade zone. According to the master plan, the development will be able to accommodate up to 90,000 people.</p>
                            <p>In terms of Dubai’s new Urban Master Plan 2040, the Emirate has decided to upgrade 3 existing urban centers and create 2 new hubs. The existing areas are as follows:</p>
                            <p>Deira and Bur Dubai will become a major historical and cultural center of the Emirate.</p>
                            <p>The functions of the business and financial center will be assigned to Downtown Dubai and Business Bay.</p>
                            <p>Dubai Marina and JBR will serve as an international leisure and tourism hub.</p>
                            <p>The 2 remaining centers are District 2020, a focal point for the exhibition, tourism and logistics sectors, and Dubai Silicon</p>
                            <p>Oasis Center, which is to become a hub for knowledge and innovation.</p>
                            <p>Over the past year, the Dubai property market has seen a trend towards limited launches of new projects. The majority of developers focused their efforts on commissioning existing real estate. Meanwhile, large companies such as Emaar, Meraas and DAMAC continued releasing new developments.</p>
                            <p>Emaar has been developing its coastal Emaar Beachfront project, while Meraas has continued to work on its iconic properties, including Bvlgari Island, Madinat Jumeirah and La Mer. Similar to Emaar, the real estate giant DAMAC Properties has expanded the development of its eponymous DAMAC Hills area.</p>
